# PutItIntoPerspective
When talking about the harm we as a society do to the environment, numbers can only go so far. Most people don't know what the differens between 100 thousand tons and 200 thousand tons of plastic waste is. I wanted to make a tool that can bring awareness to environmental problems by creating a TANGIBLE visualization of a hard to grasp number. It currently helps people to identify how harmful their local community is to the environment (their country), by showing what amount of mismanaged plastic waste (which isn't recycled) their country produces. First the user selects which country they would like to inspect on a map, where countries that are more red have a bigger amount of mismanaged plastic waste. The visualization is done by showing a series of 3d objects one after the other each of them bigger than the previous one and then the last object is the calculated mismanaged plastic waste in that country, represented with a trash bag filled with 500 ml water bottles. This can be expanded in so many ways with many other problems like the amount of glaciers that have melted in Greenland and Antarctica, the amount of oil dumped into the ocean and others.
