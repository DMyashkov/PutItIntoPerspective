What is Plastic
Overshoot day?
Plastic… is… everywhere
And the amount of plastic produced is expected to double by 2040,
which will triple the volume of plastic pollution.
The underlying issues with plastic pollution are the excessive
production and use of plastic across the planet and the lack of
sufficient waste management systems to properly process plastic after
it has been used. This results in a significant amount of plastic ending
up in the environment every year, with a staggering amount ultimately
finding its way into the ocean.
Every year, there is a day when the amount of plastic waste surpasses
the capability of waste management systems to effectively manage
it. This day is known as Plastic Overshoot Day, and in 2024, the global
community will reach this critical point on September 5th.
As with any complex issue, understanding the problem is the first step
towards implementing solutions. By tracking Plastic Overshoot Day every
year, we can identify the magnitude of the plastic waste problem, in
which direction it is evolving, and hold governments, businesses, and
individuals accountable for their contribution to the problem.
There are reasons for optimism, namely, with the global community
having recently agreed to negotiate terms for a Plastics Treaty aimed at
tackling plastic waste challenges worldwide. This global treaty should be
concluded by the end of this year.
It’s time for action. Together, we can work towards reducing plastic
consumption, improving waste management systems, promoting
sustainable alternatives, and advocating for policy changes to combat
plastic pollution and protect our oceans and the environment for
future generations.

Foreword
The latest Plastic Overshoot Day Report
arrives amid preparations for the fourth round
of negotiations for the UN Plastic Treaty
negotiations to be held in Ottawa, Canada. The
data is unequivocal: improvements in waste
management capacity are outpaced by rising
plastic production, making progress almost
invisible.
The comparative analysis of the last four
years described in our report confirm the
ever-growing threat of plastic pollution. The
assumption that increased recycling and waste
management capacity will solve the plastics
crisis is flawed. Without aggressive reduction
at the source, our struggle against plastic
pollution will be a holding pattern at best.

enforcement are a prerequisite for the
treaty’s efficacy. The staggering $5.22 trillion
investment needed by 2040 underscores the
scale of transformation required. At INC-4 and
INC-5, negotiators must move beyond rhetoric
to action.
The 2024 Plastic Overshoot Day report can
serve both as a testament to our current
trajectory and as a blueprint for necessary
action. The decisions made today will echo
through ecosystems and economies for
generations. We call for a steadfast pursuit of
science-driven, robust policy that matches
the scale of the plastic pollution problem. Let
2024 be the year we pivot to a trajectory that
embraces reduction, ensuring the legacy we
leave is not one buried in plastic.

The report « Towards Ending Plastic Pollution by
2040 » proposes 15 global rules for a systemic
overhaul. Their adoption and stringent

Glossary
Collection rate
Ratio between the plastic waste collected
and generated. Waste Collected includes:
Waste export, Recycling, Properly disposed and
Improperly disposed.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
A policy approach where brands, plastic
packaging producers and importers are held
accountable for the environmental impact of
their products throughout their lifecycle by
paying a fee. EPR policies are based on the
“polluter pays” principle.
Export
Export of any plastic by the country, in any
form, be it primary polymer, plastic product,
or plastic embedded in a product. It does not
include export of plastic waste.
Import
Import of any plastic into the country, in any
form, be it primary polymer, plastic product,
or plastic embedded in a product. It does not
include import of plastic waste.

8

Improperly disposed
Waste fraction that is disposed in a waste
management system where leakage is
expected to occur, such as a dumpsite or an
unsanitary landfill. A dumpsite is a particular
area where large quantities of waste are
deliberately disposed in an uncontrolled
manner and can be the result of both the
formal and informal sectors. A landfill is
considered as unsanitary when waste
management quality standards are not met,
thus creating the potential for leakage.
Mismanaged
The sum of uncollected and improperly
managed waste.
Mismanaged Waste Index (MWI)
The sum of uncollected and improperly
managed waste, divided by the waste
generated.
Leakage
Plastic that is released into rivers, lakes and
oceans.

www.plasticovershoot.earth

Production
Polymer production either from primary virgin
source or secondary source (recycled plastic
from previous year). It does not include the
manufacturing of final products in the country,
as this would lead to double counting.
Properly disposed
Waste fraction that is disposed in a waste
management system where no leakage is
expected to occur, such as an incineration
facility or a sanitary landfill.
Incineration
« Proper » incineration is technology that
destroys waste through burning while
respecting technical requirements and
operating conditions to avoid environmental
pollution.
Sanitary landfill
Particular area where large quantities of waste
are deliberately disposed in a controlled
manner (e.g. waste being covered on a daily
basis, as well as the bottom of the landfill
designed in a way to prevent waste from
leaching out).

Domestic recycling
Recycling of waste collected in the country.
This does not include recycling of imported
waste or waste collected for recycling in the
country that is exported abroad.
Uncollected (excl. littering)
Waste fraction that is not collected, either by
the formal or the informal sector. It excludes
littering.
Littering
The act of dropping rubbish on the ground in
public areas.
Waste export
Plastic waste collected in the country and
exported abroad. It does not include the reexport of imported waste.
Waste generated
Country domestic plastic waste generation
computed as: Production + Import – Export –
Added stock.
Waste import
Import of plastic waste from other countries.

01. Introductory note
This report provides a full assessment of the contribution to plastic pollution
worldwide through the lense of the Plastic Overshoot Days since 2021, with a focus
on this year’s date. It is based on the baseline year 2024 from municipal solid waste
(packaging, textile and household), with a global plastic production of 220 Mt, that
is distributed across different country archetypes: The Moderate Polluters, The
Overloaders, The Low-Waste-Producing Polluters, The Toxic Waste Producers, The
Transactors, The Self-Sustainers.
The intention of this research is not to criticise the countries waste management, but
to increase the level of knowledge and awareness of the issue, so as to pave the way
towards a better plastic management system.
This report therefore fills a key knowledge gap and provides a new and important
insight to enable us to better prioritise research and actions around macro- and
micro-plastic leakage, and plastic pollution in general.
Systemic solutions should be developed and implemented by the concerned
countries.

DISCLAIMER:
As for the Earth Overshoot Day, the Plastic Overshoot Day is estimated and published annually.
Revisions to calculations and scope may occur between yearly publications due to improved data
and new findings taking place over time. Therefore, for consistency with the latest reported data and
scientific understanding, Overshoot dates for past years are recalculated in every new publication,
ensuring each year’s metrics share a common dataset and calculation methods. Values may be
readjusted compared to previous communications. Consequently, we suggest readers to always refer
to the latest Plastic Overshoot Day publication, where all values are comparable. Looking at media
accounts from previous years may lead to inaccurate conclusions.
The information and data in this report regarding Plastic Overshoot Day, including estimates on
additives leakage and microplastic leakage, are provided for informational purposes only. Plastic
Overshoot Day is an estimate and not an exact date. We have made reasonable efforts to ensure
accuracy; however, it is important to note that science knowledge on synthetic textile is less
advanced than for packaging and that the estimates for additives and microplastics may be less
detailed. These estimates are approximations and should not replace comprehensive studies. This
report does not constitute legal or professional advice and should not be relied upon as such. The
authors, publishers, and distributors of this report are not liable for errors or consequences arising
from its use. Please note that the field of plastic waste management is constantly evolving, and new
research may impact the understanding of the issues discussed. Readers are encouraged to stay
informed about the latest developments. By accessing and using this report, you agree to the above
disclaimer and accept that the authors, publishers, and distributors are not responsible for any claims

02. Summary
Plastic Overshoot Day marks the point when the amount of
plastic waste generated from single use packaging, household
and textile sectors exceeds the world’s capacity to manage it,
resulting in environmental pollution. In 2024, the global Plastic
Overshoot Day is projected to occur on September 5th. Each
country has its own Plastic Overshoot Day, which is determined
by the amount of plastic waste generated and the country’s
capacity to manage it.​
The Plastic Overshoot Day alone does not
provide the whole picture of this complex
issue. Hence, to facilitate targeted and
effective solutions, six country archetypes
have been established, enabling the profiling
of countries based on determining factors
such as local per capita plastic consumption,
the import and export volumes of waste, and
the country’s waste treatment capabilities. By
considering these archetypes, we can present
recommendations tailored to each country’s
unique circumstances.
These recommendations aim to empower
countries to improve their Overshoot
Day and mitigate plastic pollution. They

12

include strategies such as reducing plastic
consumption and usage, promoting circular
economy models such as repair and reuse
initiatives, implementing robust waste
management policies like extended producer
responsibilities (EPR), enhancing local waste
management infrastructure, and ceasing the
import of plastic waste from other countries.
By adopting measures relevant to their
situation, countries can make significant
progress in combatting plastic pollution.

Who contributes to the Plastic Overshoot Day?
In 2024, there are 117 days of plastic overshoot, meaning that the plastic waste produced during
these days will not be well managed. Each country contributes to a portion of this plastic
overshoot, according to the total amount of plastic waste they mismanage.

In the first 248 days of
2024, plastic waste is well-

managed, meaning it is
collected and then either
recycled, incinerated, or
deposited in a sanitary
landfill.

The remaining 205
countries account
for 40% of the total
mismanaged waste,

03. Executive summary
A little (or big) story of plastic
pollution…​
Global plastic pollution is an aggregated
contribution of each country. It depends on
how much plastic waste is generated from
consumption by each country and how much of
this waste is mismanaged and may eventually
leak in the environment.

The global average plastic waste generated
by person and per year is 28 kg, with a total
worldwide generation of 220 million tons per
year. Diving into regional differences, ​plastic
waste generation varies among countries and
individuals, with some producing more plastic
waste per capita than others. ​

People living in Belgium are
the top generators of plastic
waste in 2024, with a yearly
waste production of 147.7 kg per
person. This is 16 times higher
than in Bangladesh where each
inhabitant generates 8.6 kg of
plastic waste.

Despite lower level of waste generation per
capita, a country’s total waste production
can be quite high due to its large territory and
large population. An example is China, which
is expected to produce almost four times
less waste per capita in 2024 (39 kg/capita)
than Belgium but is the top one plastic waste
producer at the national level, with expected

56 million tons produced in 2024. This is 142
times larger than Ecuador.
Nevertheless, plastic waste generation
is a global issue, with an expected total
waste generation of 220 million tons in 2024
worldwide.​

Countries have varying capacities to
effectively manage the plastic waste they
generate, with some having more advanced
waste management systems than others.​In
total, around 69.5 million tons of plastic is

expected to be mismanaged globally this year
and potentially end up in the environment​. The
global average mismanaged plastic waste per
person is projected to be 8.8 kg in 2024.

The imbalance between the volumes of plastic
that are produced and used, and the world’s
ability to manage those volumes when they
become waste, is the root cause of plastic
pollution. ​

The mismatch of waste management capacity
versus plastic consumption is called the MWI,
the mismanaged waste index. ​

Globally in 2024, a staggering 31.5% of plastic
waste will be mismanaged at the end of its life,
with the risk of this waste ending up in oceans. ​
Countries trade plastic waste between each
other. The biggest waste exporter is Slovenia,
with exports of plastic waste that corresponds
in quantity to 61.8% of its domestic waste
generated. Nevertheless, Slovenia imports the
same amount of plastic waste from abroad.

On the contrary, Norway is the biggest net
exporter, since it exports the equivalent of
23.1% of its domestic waste while only importing
the equivalent of 1.6% of its plastic waste
production from other countries.
Pollution is created when plastic waste is
exported in countries that have very low waste
management capacities.

Plastic Overshoot Day marks the point when
the amount of plastic waste generated
exceeds the world’s capacity to manage it,
resulting in environmental pollution. In 2024,
the global Plastic Overshoot Day is projected
to occur on September 5th. It’s important to

note that each country has its own Plastic
Overshoot Day, which is determined by the
amount of plastic waste generated and the
country’s capacity to manage it.​

Archetypes criteria
Plastic Overshoot Day looked to establish categories,
or archetypes of countries, so that countries could be
profiled and relevant and meaningful solutions could be
presented and explored.
The criteria used to profile the countries are based on:
• The volumes of waste generated per capita in the country
• The level of mismanaged waste in the country, treated both domestically and
exported
• The volume of waste that the country imports from other countries, proportionally to
its domestic waste production
• The portion of domestic waste that the country exports to other countries
The below table summarizes the thresholds applied for each of the criteria.

Country archetypes & country examples
Plastic Overshoot Day aims to offer insights into
interventions that countries can use to reduce overall
plastic waste and in particular, mitigate mismanaged
plastic waste, therefore prolonging the country’s
overshoot date.
Each country has unique realities related to plastic pollution – including plastic usage
levels, waste management infrastructure, and relevant policies – Plastic Overshoot
Day looked to establish categories so that countries could be profiled and relevant
and meaningful solutions could be presented and explored.
6 Country Archetypes have been defined, which represent countries based on:
• The amount of plastic waste the population produces
• How well plastic is managed when it becomes waste
• How much plastic waste the country exports
• How much plastic waste the country imports

05. Appendix
Scope of the study
The primary objective of this study is to comprehensively quantify plastic pollution
on a global scale and determine the global Plastic Overshoot Day, as well as the
Overshoot Day for individual countries. The study specifically focuses on plastic waste
originating from solid waste management systems, encompassing plastic packaging,
textiles and household products. It is important to note that plastics used exclusively
in industrial applications are excluded from this analysis. The research methodology
involves conducting the analysis at a global level initially and subsequently drilling
down to a country-level assessment, providing a detailed understanding of plastic
pollution trends and challenges worldwide.

Yearly production of plastic in the world
Plastic Overshoot Day sheds light on a critical aspect of the world’s plastic
consumption: short-life plastics, encompassing plastic packaging and singleuse plastics. These categories account for approximately 35% of the total plastic
commercialized annually. Moreover, they pose the higher risk of leakage in the
environment. Plastic Overshoot days also include the contribution of synthetic textile
to plastic pollution. This category accounts for an additional 15% of the total plastic
commercialized annually.

Methodology
At EA Earth Action, our mission is to shed light on the
critical issue of plastic pollution. We achieve this by
leveraging scientific research to quantify the magnitude
of the problem, and by empowering individuals and
organizations to find solutions. To this end, we place a
high value on transparency regarding our methodology
for measuring plastic pollution. We believe that clear
and comprehensive information on our methodology is
crucial to building trust with stakeholders.
The methodological guide explains the concept underpinning Plastic Overshoot Day:
the Mismanaged Waste Index, and how it is computed.
This methodological guide will also draw on concepts used in the narrative of Plastic
Overshoot Day, such as the classifications of countries with regard to management of
plastic waste.
The Mismanaged Waste Index (MWI) is a metric used to quantify the amount of
plastic waste that is not properly managed in a locally and therefore ends up in the
environment.
Because many countries export their plastic waste, it is critical to account for the
fate of the exported waste.

Plastic… is… everywhere
And the amount of plastic produced is expected to double by
2040, which will triple the volume of plastic pollution.
The underlying issues with plastic pollution are the excessive
production and use of plastic across the planet and the lack
of sufficient waste management systems to properly process
plastic after it has been used. This results in a significant
amount of plastic ending up in the environment every year, with a
staggering amount ultimately finding its way into the ocean.
Every year, there is a day when the amount of plastic waste
surpasses the capability of waste management systems to
effectively manage it. This day is known as Plastic Overshoot Day,
and in 2024, the global community will reach this critical point on
September 5th.
It’s time for action.
Together, we can work towards reducing plastic consumption,
improving waste management systems, promoting sustainable
alternatives, and advocating for policy changes to combat
plastic pollution and protect our oceans and the environment
for future generations.
